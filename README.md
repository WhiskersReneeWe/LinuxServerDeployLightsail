# Linux Server Configuration and Web Application Deployment

## Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree Final Project
The goal of this Capstone project is to deploy a web application built from a previous project to a publicly accessible Ubuntu linux server. I use AWS Lightsail instance as the Virtual linux server and Ubuntu as its operating system for this project. 

## Project Detail

* Public IP Address: 54.218.238.1
* Access the Virtual Linux Server by ```ssh -i LightsailUdacityLinux.pem ubuntu@54.218.238.1```
